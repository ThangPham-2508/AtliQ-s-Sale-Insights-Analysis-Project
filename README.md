# AtliQ-s-Sale-Insights-Analysis-Project
•	Created an automated dashboard for a computer hardware business (AtliQ) which is facing challenges in scaling within a dynamically changing market and lacking actionable insights.

•	Performed data analysis using Excel and Power BI to track revenue growth, year-over-year (YOY) trends, and region-wise sales performance.

•	The dashboard enabled quick, data-informed decisions, effectively displaying sales trends and potentially raising revenue by at least 7% in the next quarter.
